   Nvidia and AMD’s high-end graphics cards were already expensive in 2020 (if you could find them), but their prices are only going up. And we’re finally starting to see just how dramatic these price hikes are going to be.

As of December 31, 2020, GPUs and motherboards are now included in tariffs the Trump administration placed on Chinese imports. These PC components were previously exempt from said tariffs, but those exceptions expired at the end of last year and no extensions have been applied. That means prices are rising by as much as 25 percent for high-end GPUs—including Nvidia’s new RTX 3090, 3080, 3070, and 3060 Ti, and AMD’s RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT.

  Nvidia and AMD’s latest GPUs were nearly impossible to buy in 2020 to begin with, as COVID-19 affected manufacturing and supply chains. Retailers typically sold out in mere seconds every time they restocked, no thanks to scalpers and cryptocurrency miners that used bots to buy up as many graphics cards as possible.

The purchasing experience got bad enough that many retailers implemented anti-bot tactics like waitlists, more aggressive human verification systems, and strict limits on how many GPUs customers can purchase. However, these tariffs are only going to make the process more difficult—and expensive—even if you’re lucky enough to score a card.
